"Guess the Number" is a fun and interactive Java project developed using object-oriented programming principles and a graphical user interface (GUI). The project allows users to play a number guessing game with the computer.

The game starts by generating a random number within a specified range. The user is prompted to enter their guess through a user-friendly dialogue box provided by the GUI. The computer then compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum number of attempts.

The project incorporates various features to enhance the user experience. It allows the user to set the range of numbers, specifying the minimum and maximum values for the random number generation. This customization adds flexibility and enables players to adapt the game to their desired difficulty level.

To make the game more challenging, a limit is imposed on the number of attempts the user can make. This restriction forces players to strategize and think carefully before submitting their guesses. It adds an element of suspense and excitement, as users strive to guess the number within the limited attempts.

In addition, the project includes a scoring mechanism to track the user's performance. The score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly. This feature not only adds a competitive element to the game but also encourages players to improve their guessing skills and aim for a higher score.

The graphical user interface is built using the Swing framework, which provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The GUI components, such as labels, text fields, and buttons, are intuitively designed to guide users through the gameplay and provide a seamless experience.

The project follows the principles of object-oriented programming, leveraging classes and objects to encapsulate the game logic and GUI components. This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability, making the code easier to understand and extend.

Overall, "Guess the Number" offers an engaging and entertaining way for users to test their guessing skills while practicing Java programming concepts and GUI development. It combines interactive gameplay, customizable settings, scoring, and a visually appealing interface to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for players of all ages.
